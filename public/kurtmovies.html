<h1>The Best Movies According to Kurt</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Olympus Has Fallen</h3>
        <p> The first in the "Has Fallen" Trilogy and a perfect introduction to the all-action style of the protagonist Mike Banning as he attempts to rescue President Benjamin Asher from a terorist attack inside the White House. I love this movie for its action scenes and in my opinion, well written plot. 
    <h3>London Has Fallen</h3>
        <p> The second installment in the series ramps up the action even more as Banning races to keep President Asher safe from an unrelenting terrorist attack in Central London. I love this movie because it's a great follow up to the first movie and the pace of this one never lets up!</p>
    <h3>Angel Has Fallen</h3>
        <p>The third installment in the series sees Banning pursued as the suspect in an assassination attempt on now President Alan Trumbull. This movie is a favourite of mine due to the plot portraying Banning as an anti-hero who must fight to clear his name and find who has set him up. </p>
